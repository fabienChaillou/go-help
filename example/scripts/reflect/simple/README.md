## golang simple example reflect with tests

I'd be happy to provide a simple example of reflection in Go along with tests. 
Reflection in Go allows programs to examine and modify their own structure during runtime, which can be very powerful for certain use cases.

Let's create a simple example that demonstrates basic reflection functionality and include comprehensive tests.

I've created a simple Go package that demonstrates reflection with comprehensive tests. Let me explain the components:

1. Main Package (main.go)

The main package includes several functions that showcase reflection in Go:

* GetFieldNames: Extracts all field names from a struct
* GetFieldTags: Gets struct tag values for a specific tag key
* SetField: Dynamically sets a field's value using its name
* DumpStructValues: Prints all fields and their values

These functions demonstrate common reflection tasks like examining struct fields, reading struct tags, and modifying struct values at runtime.

2. Tests (main_test.go)

The tests thoroughly validate each reflection function with different scenarios:

* Testing with both struct values and pointers
* Error handling for invalid inputs
* Edge cases like non-existent fields or type mismatches
* Output verification for functions that print to stdout

3. Example Usage (example_usage.go)

This file shows how to use the reflection functions in a practical application:

* Creating a struct instance
* Getting field names and struct tags
* Modifying struct fields dynamically
* Displaying struct information

### How to Run
To run the tests:

```shell
bashcd /path/to/your/package
go test -v
```

To run the example:

```shell
bash
go run example_usage.go
```

## Key Reflection Concepts Demonstrated

1. Type Inspection: Examining the structure of types at runtime
2. Value Manipulation: Modifying values using reflection
3. Struct Tags: Reading metadata from struct field tags
4. Safety Checks: Proper error handling when using reflection
