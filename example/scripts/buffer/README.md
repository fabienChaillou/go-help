## buffer io with test

I'd be happy to provide a simple Go example that demonstrates how to use buffers. Buffers are commonly used in Go for efficient string manipulation, reading, and writing operations.

Here's a simple example that covers basic buffer operations:

This example covers the fundamental operations with Go buffers:

1. String Building - Using bytes.Buffer to efficiently append strings
2. Byte Operations - Working with raw bytes in a buffer
3. strings.Builder - An alternative that's optimized for string concatenation
4. Reading from Buffers - How to read content from a buffer
5. Pre-populated Buffers - Creating buffers with existing data

To run this code:

1. Save it to a file named `buffer_example.go`
2. Execute it with `go run buffer_example.go`


### with unit tests


I've created an expanded version that includes both the original buffer examples and comprehensive tests for buffer operations in Go. Here's what the example now includes:

### Main Features:

1. The original buffer examples showing basic operations
2. Three reusable buffer utility functions:

    * ConcatStrings: Joins strings using a buffer
    * ProcessBytes: Manipulates byte content within a buffer
    * BuildWithFormat: Creates formatted text using strings.Builder



### Test Coverage:

1. TestConcatStrings: Verifies string concatenation works correctly
2. TestProcessBytes: Ensures byte manipulation functions properly
3. TestBuildWithFormat: Checks string formatting with builders

### How to Run:

1. Save the file as buffer_example.go
2. To run the examples: go run buffer_example.go
3. To run the tests: go test buffer_example.go

This demonstrates Go's testing framework with buffer operations and shows good practices for writing unit tests in Go, including table-driven tests that verify multiple scenarios.
