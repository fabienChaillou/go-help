// Multiple functions can read from the same channel until that channel is closed; this is called fan-out.
// This provides a way to distribute work amongst a group of workers to parallelize CPU use and I/O.

// A function can read from multiple inputs and proceed until all are closed
// by multiplexing the input channels onto a single channel thatâ€™s closed when all the inputs are closed.
// This is called fan-in.

// We can change our pipeline to run two instances of sq, each reading from the same input channel.
// We introduce a new function, merge, to fan in the results:
func main() {
	in := gen(2, 3)

	// Distribute the sq work across two goroutines that both read from in.
	c1 := sq(in)
	c2 := sq(in)

	// Consume the merged output from c1 and c2.
	for n := range merge(c1, c2) {
		fmt.Println(n) // 4 then 9, or 9 then 4
	}
}
